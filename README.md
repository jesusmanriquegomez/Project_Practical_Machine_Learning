# Project_Practical_Machine_Learning



Project for the Coursera course Practical Machine Learning

In this project, biometric data is given to predict people performance in one given task. The performance is a categorical variable (5 levels).

I trained a Random Forest using  Caret R library. Due to the limitations of my local machine (Macbook Pro),  I reached a compromise between performance and computational times.

The accuracy of the model is around 99%
